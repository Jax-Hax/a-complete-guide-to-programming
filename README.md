# A complete guide to programming
A full path to learning how to code, no need for analysis paralysis. Starting from absolutely nothing.
Here is the general layout:
- First, you need to get interested in learning to code, as well as learn the fundamentals. This is going to bring you from nothing to making Chess, with Python.
- Then, you are going to move into web dev. We will be using the React framework, because it is the best one to get hired. This uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You will make a personal website to display info about you.
- Finally, you need to get some experience to put on your resume. This is done by making projects. It is up to you what to make, but it needs to be unique and eye catching. I suggest doing a mainly backend and a mainly frontend project. For backend, you can do an evolution simulator or a neural network. For frontend, try making an animated website, possibly as a redesign of your personal website. Look at websites like the Github join screen for inspiration.


Roadmap:
1. Learn the basics of Python. Print to the command line, then take a user's name and say hi to them.
2. Start with variables, if statements, and math operations. Also learn pseudocode, by planning out the calculator and guessing game. Make a calculator, then a guessing game.
3. Learn lists and functions by making hangman then blackjack
5. Learn libraries by making a selenium client to interact with goodreads and lookup by author from command line
6. OOP by making a book review list
